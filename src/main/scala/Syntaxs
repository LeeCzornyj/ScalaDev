+ - * / all standard as is % for mod

relational operators of
== != <= >= < > all standard as well

logical operators of
&& || ! still the same

Assignment operators
= standard
+= - C+=A > C = C+A
-= - C-=A > C = C-A
*= - C*=A > C = C*A
/= - C/=A > C = C/A
%= - C%=A > C = C%A

given 2 vals such as List(1,2,3) and List(4,5,6)
can use ne or eq to compare the 2
i.e
list1 ne list2 = true
list1 eq list2 = false
